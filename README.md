# Toronto Crime Rates

## Overview of Paper

This repository explores neighbourhoods that were most effected by crime and how crime rates have changed over time using the Neighbourhood Crime Rate data was pulled from the City of Toronto Open Portal. I chose ten neighbourhoods that had the highest number of crimes to conduct further analysis using Toronto Census data. In my exploratory analysis, I find that neighbourhoods who experience higher crime rates are also found to be economically disadvantaged communities. This data, without a further analysis and understanding of socioeconomic circumstances could lead to higher police surveillance and further punitive action towards marginalized communities.
